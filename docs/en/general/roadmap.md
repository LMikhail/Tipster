## 3. Versioning Principles

To ensure transparency and predictability in the development process, we adhere to the following versioning principle until the `v1.0.0` release.

**Format:** `0.MAJOR.MINOR`
*   `0.` ‚Äî Indicates that the project is in active development and the API may undergo changes.
*   `MAJOR` ‚Äî Corresponds to the **strategic stage** number. An increase in this number (e.g., from `v0.1.x` to `v0.2.0`) signifies the completion of one major stage and the transition to the next.
*   `MINOR` ‚Äî Denotes incremental releases within a single stage that add new functionality.

## 4. Major Development Stages

### Stage 1: `v0.1.x` ‚Äî Foundation
**Goal:** To create a powerful, stable, and high-performance logic core that will serve as the foundation for the entire platform.

**Key Features:**
*   [ ] **Full-fledged Unification:**
    *   Implementation of Robinson's unification algorithm.
    *   Correct `occur check` to prevent infinite loops.
    *   Efficient substitution system.
    *   A well-defined system for logical variables (context, scope).
*   [ ] **Inference Engine:**
    *   Implementation of a backtracking mechanism with choice points to find all solutions.
    *   Returning results as lazy sequences.
    *   Basic search strategy: Depth-First Search.
*   [ ] **Stable Core API:**
    *   Transition from temporary macros (`deffact`, `defrule`) to canonical constructs (`def`, `defn::l`).
    *   Stabilization of the semantics and API for invocation modifiers (`::l`, `::f`, `::seq`).
*   [ ] **Compiler Scaffolding (Translator):**
    *   Parsing of Core API constructs and their transformation into structures understandable by the logic engine.
*   [ ] **Basic In-Memory Knowledge Base:**
    *   Efficient in-memory storage of facts and rules.
    *   Basic predicate-based indexing to speed up searches.
*   [ ] **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Profiling and benchmarking of key operations (unification, search).

**Success Criteria:**
*   The logic engine correctly finds all solutions for complex recursive queries (e.g., pathfinding in graphs).
*   A comprehensive set of unit and integration tests covers more than 90% of the core logic.
*   Benchmarks show performance comparable to or exceeding similar functions in well-known Prolog systems for representative tasks.
*   The core API (`def`, `defn::l`, etc.) is stable and well-documented.

**Current Status (based on `v0.0.3`):**
*   Stub macros for `deffact` and `defrule` are implemented.
*   Simplistic unification without backtracking.
*   REPL integration.

### Stage 2: `v0.2.x` ‚Äî Integration
**Goal:** To ensure seamless interaction between Tipster and the existing Clojure ecosystem and external data sources.

**Key Features:**
*   [ ] **Clojure Collections Integration:** The ability to use standard Clojure collections as native data sources in logic rules.
*   [ ] **External Function Calls:** Safe and efficient invocation of regular Clojure functions from logic code with automatic data passing.
*   [ ] **Universal Data Adapters:**
    *   Implementation of protocols for connecting to external databases.
    *   SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) adapters.
    *   Transparent translation of parts of logic queries into native database queries.
*   [ ] **Federated Queries (alpha):** The ability to execute a single logic query against data residing in multiple sources simultaneously (e.g., in-memory + PostgreSQL).
*   [ ] **Extension API:** A mechanism for creating custom connectors and predicates.

**Success Criteria:**
*   A single query can be written that combines data from the internal knowledge base, a Clojure vector, and a PostgreSQL table.
*   The process of creating a new data adapter is clearly documented and demonstrated with a working example.
*   Calling a standard Clojure function from a Tipster rule is as simple as calling a predicate.
*   Performance degradation for federated queries is predictable and within reasonable limits.

### Stage 3: `v0.3.x` ‚Äî Unification
**Goal:** To implement the project's key technology‚Äîa unified knowledge space (PKVT) that blurs the lines between code, data, and metadata.

**Key Features:**
*   [ ] **Universal PKVT Structure:**
    *   Introduction of the `Parent-Key-Value-Type` atomic structure to represent all entities.
    *   `Parent`: The context or owning object.
    *   `Key`: The name of an attribute, predicate, or function.
    *   `Value`: The value of an attribute or the body of a function.
    *   `Type`: The entity type (`:fact`, `:rule`, `:function`, `:data`).
*   [ ] **Compiler Evolution (PKVT Constructor):**
    *   Implementation of logic for the complete decomposition of all definitions (`def`, `defn`, `defn::l`) into a set of PKVT records.
    *   Automatic composition (assembly) of objects from PKVT records for use in code.
*   [ ] **Universal Knowledge Base:**
    *   Transitioning the internal representation of all project entities to PKVT storage.
*   [ ] **Hybrid Queries:**
    *   The ability to execute queries that search for both data and code simultaneously (e.g., "find all functions that call the `parent` predicate").
*   [ ] **Multi-dimensional Indexing:**
    *   Creation of efficient indexes (PK, PV, KV, PKV, etc.) for ultra-fast searches across the knowledge space.
    *   Automatic statistics and adaptive indexing based on usage patterns.
*   [ ] **Optional Persistence:**
    *   Saving and loading the knowledge space to/from disk.
    *   A Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mechanism to ensure integrity.

**Success Criteria:**
*   The entire codebase of the project (rules, facts, functions) can be represented and stored in the PKVT structure without loss of information.
*   A query like "find all functions that use the `parent` predicate and were defined by user 'X'" can be successfully executed.
*   Query performance against the PKVT-based knowledge base is comparable to the previous in-memory version for data-oriented queries.
*   The knowledge base can be successfully saved to disk and reloaded, restoring the system to its previous state.

*   [ ] **REST API and WebSocket:**
    *   Providing full access to data and queries via an HTTP API.
    *   A `/query` endpoint for executing queries.
    *   WebSocket support for streaming large result sets.
*   [ ] **Web Interface (Alpha):**
    *   **Knowledge Browser:** A UI for navigating objects and their relationships.
    *   **Query Editor:** An interactive editor with syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
    *   **Dashboard:** Displaying key metrics and system status.
*   [ ] **CLI (Command-Line Interface):**
    *   A tool for managing projects, executing queries, and running migrations from the command line.
*   [ ] **Security and Access Control:**
    *   Basic authentication and authorization mechanisms for the API and UI.

**Success Criteria:**
*   A developer can debug a non-working query using tracing and introspection tools in their REPL.
*   A web application can be created that uses the REST API to query and display data from Tipster.
*   A new user can set up a project and run their first query within 15 minutes using the CLI and documentation.
*   The web interface allows intuitive browsing of the knowledge graph and interactive query execution.

### Stage 5: `v0.5.x` ‚Äî Intelligence
**Goal:** To empower the system with capabilities for automatic optimization and intelligent query execution.

**Key Features:**
*   [ ] **Intelligent Execution Pipeline:** Creation and integration of three key modules working in tandem:
    *   **Static Analysis (AOT Compilation):** Evolving the compiler to perform preliminary optimizations during code loading. This includes type checking, partial evaluation, and preparing structures for faster runtime optimization.
    *   **Query Optimizer:** A module for dynamic (runtime) analysis of queries. It is responsible for building an optimal execution plan based on heuristics, data statistics, and the results of static analysis.
    *   **JIT Compilation (Just-In-Time):** On-the-fly compilation of the optimal plan provided by the optimizer into highly efficient native code for the execution engine.
*   [ ] **Strategy Planner:** Introduction of mixed-mode invocation strategies (`::fl`, `::lf`) and automatic selection of the best strategy based on statistics.
*   [ ] **Materialized Views:** The ability to cache the results of complex rules to speed up repeated queries.
*   [ ] **Machine Learning Elements:** Integration with ML libraries to create predicates based on probabilistic models.

**Success Criteria:**
*   For a non-trivial query, the query optimizer can demonstrate (e.g., through an `EXPLAIN` command) that it changed the order of joins to reduce the search space.
*   Enabling JIT compilation provides measurable performance improvement (e.g., >30%) for long-running and complex queries.
*   The system can automatically choose between different computation strategies (`::l`, `::f`) based on data statistics to improve performance.
*   A complex, frequently used rule can be materialized, and subsequent queries using it execute an order of magnitude faster.

## 5. Future Goals

*   **`v1.0.0` ‚Äî Production Ready:** The first production-grade version. This release marks the completion of all five major development stages (v0.1.x - v0.5.x). The system will have a stable API, a powerful logic core, integration mechanisms, a unified knowledge base (PKVT), and an **intelligent execution pipeline**. Tipster will be ready for use in production projects.
*   **`v2.0.0` and beyond ‚Äî Universal Data Platform:** Evolution into a full-fledged universal data platform. It will not only be able to compete with traditional DBMSs in tasks requiring complex logic but also serve as a foundation for the rapid implementation of domain-specific platforms (e.g., for accounting or process management), which are built on it as specialized configurations.
