(defn item [product qty amount])

;; Dual semantics in action - queries look like regular Clojure code
(->> (invoice ?id "Purchase" ?date ?total ?items)
     (filter #(> (:date %) "2024-01-01"))
     (mapcat :items)
     (group-by :product)
     (map (fn [[product items]]
            [product (reduce + (map :amount items))]))
     (sort-by second >))

;; Logical rules integrate naturally
(defn profitable-invoice [id]
  (and (invoice id ?type ?date ?total ?items)
       (> ?total 1000)
       (= ?type "Purchase")))

;; Query with rules - same syntax

;; Logical inference in unified knowledge space:
(defn customer [name id orders])  ; facts from any sources
(defn order [id date total items])  ; system level hides sources

;; Tipster doesn't know data origin - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or file:
(->> (and (customer ?name ?id ?orders)
          (order ?order-id ?date ?total ?items)
          (member ?order-id ?orders)
          (> ?date "2024-01-01"))
     (map #(hash-map :customer-name ?name :order-total ?total))
     (sort-by :order-total >))
