### Current Limitations

⚠️ **Limited Rule Engine**
- Simple rules only, complex inference chains have limitations
- No advanced backtracking or constraint solving
- Missing optimization for large knowledge bases

⚠️ **No Persistence**
- In-memory only, no database integration
- No transaction support or ACID properties
- No distributed capabilities

⚠️ **Basic Query System**
- Simple pattern matching only
- No advanced query optimization
- No aggregation or analytical queries
