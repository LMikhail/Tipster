# Tipster Version History

## Current Version: 0.0.3 - Early Development

**Release Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Early Development - Basic Logic Foundation

### What's Implemented (v0.0.3)

✅ **Basic Logic Engine**
- Simple term creation and unification algorithm
- Basic variable binding system with occurs check
- Minimal knowledge base (in-memory facts and rules)
- Simple query system with pattern matching
- Bilingual support (English/Russian)

✅ **Developer Experience**
- 6 interactive examples (basic, family, rules, animals, math, interactive)
- Basic test suite covering core functionality
- REPL-friendly development
- Modular architecture foundation

✅ **Infrastructure**
- Internationalization system
- Bilingual documentation structure
- Example runner scripts
- Basic testing framework

### Current Limitations

⚠️ **Early Development Stage**
- Basic logic engine, not production-ready
- Simple rules only, limited inference capabilities
- No advanced backtracking or constraint solving
- Missing optimization for larger knowledge bases

⚠️ **No Persistence**
- In-memory only, no database integration
- No transaction support or ACID properties
- No distributed capabilities

⚠️ **Temporary Constructs**
- `deffact`/`defrule`/`query` macros are temporary
- No dual semantics implementation yet
- Limited query capabilities
